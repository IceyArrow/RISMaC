        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            RISMaC is an inter-school team based mathematics contest for high schoolers all based on non-routine fields of mathematics like number theory, geometry, combinatorics, algebra, and analysis. We have multiple exciting rounds in our event which would be a dream for a mathematics enthusiast. We would have teams of 4 participating from various schools throughout NCR, independent teams are welcome with special approval of the school authority.

                <h3>Power Round</h3>

            <p>
                Power round will be a team round and also the longest round of the contest as the questions will be given 24 hours before the contest online. It will be based on an advanced concept which is not a part of high school curriculum, standard or contest. The concept will be explained throughout the document with questions in between. A strict list of standard online tools would be allowed for the competition, which would include WikiPedia, Wolfram Alpha, etc. The exact list would be provided via e-mail before the contest.

                <h3>Individual Round</h3>

            <p>
                Individual rounds will be independent of your team, and will be segregated into 4 subjects, Algebra and Number Theory, Combinatorics, Geometry, and Calculus. A participant is meant to choose 2 of the above and give these in 1 hour windows each during the contest according to the schedule. This would be a speed contest and the only the answers will be written on an answer sheet.

                <h3>Team Round</h3>

            <p>
                
                Team Round will be a 90 minute standard examination like the individual rounds which would be held during the contest hours. The question paper would consist of comparatively more exciting and less trivial questions which would be meant to be group solved. This would be a proof-based subjective round.

            <h3>Relay Round</h3>

            <p> 
                This 60 minute round will be similar to a relay race, problems of various difficulties and points will be assorted on the sheet. Each team would send a runner for a problem who would partially or fully solve a few problems while creating helpful notes for the other runner. Each runner when going back would show the answers to the checker and scoring would happen in real time, he/she would also have to pass their notes regarding a partially solved problem to the coming runner, if any.
